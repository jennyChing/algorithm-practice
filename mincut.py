#The file contains the adjacency list representation of a simple undirected graph.
#There are 40 vertices labeled 1 to 40. The first column in the file represents the vertex label,
#and the particular row other entries except the first column tells all the vertices that the vertex is adjacent to.
#So for example, the 6th row looks liks : "6 29 32 37 27 16".
#This just means that the vertex with label 6 is adjacent to (i.e., shares an edge with) the vertices with labels 29, 32, 37, 27 and 16.

#Your task is to code up and run the randomized contraction algorithm for the min cut problem and use it on the above graph to compute the min cut.
#Note that you'll have to figure out an implementation of edge contractions.
#Initially, you might want to do this naively, creating a new graph from the old every time there's an edge contraction.
# please make sure to run the algorithm many times with different random seeds, and remember the smallest cut that you ever find
#Output -  numeric answer. e.g., if your answer is 5, prints 5

#this is a graph min-cut problem
#implementation of Kargers algorithm
#probabilty of success is order 1 by sqr n
#by Monte Carlo sampling, repeating this experiment over again gets the min value
